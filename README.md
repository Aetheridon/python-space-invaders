# Python Space Invaders

Python Space Invaders is my own spin-off of the arcade game Space Invaders in Python using the Arcade library

## Setup

To run this program you must create a virtual environment and install the [arcade](https://pypi.org/project/arcade/) library and you will need Python 3 and Pip installed on your system.

Linux:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/stilte/python-space-invaders.git
cd python-space-invaders
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```
